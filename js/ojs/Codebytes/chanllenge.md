Division Stringified:
Using the JavaScript language, have the function DivisionStringified(num1,num2) take both parameters being passed, divide num1 by num2, and return the result as a string with properly formatted commas. If an answer is only 3 digits long, return the number with no commas (ie. 2 / 3 should output "1"). For example: if num1 is 123456789 and num2 is 10000 the output should be "12,346". 

Counting Minutes I:
Using the JavaScript language, have the function CountingMinutesI(str) take the str parameter being passed which will be two times (each properly formatted with a colon and am or pm) separated by a hyphen and return the total number of minutes between the two times. The time will be in a 12 hour clock format. For example: if str is 9:00am-10:00am then the output should be 60. If str is 1:00pm-11:00am the output should be 1320.
